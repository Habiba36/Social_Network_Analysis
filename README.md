# Social_Network_Analysis
Mini Social networks analysis tool

It is a desktop software for network analysis and visualization. It is a tool used by
data analysts and researchers to explore graphs of different networks. It enables
users to interact with the graphs in many ways like coloring and adjusting nodes
and edges based on calculated metrics or existing features, filtering the graphs
based on any criteria, applying different community detection methods, link
prediction techniques, and detecting influential users.
My task is implemented with an interactive system using Python (NetworkX)
requirements:
1- community detection algorithm ( e.g., Girvan Newman or Louvain algorithm) in addition to
2 -community detection evaluations ( internal and external evaluation)
3- One link analysis technique( e.g., page rank)
4- Filtering nodes based on centrality measures 
5- Adjusting nodes and edges based on calculated metrics ( node degree, edge
weight.... )
6- Basic network structure visualization.
7- Interactive visualization
8- Comparing different community detection techniques in terms of the number of communities detected and evaluation criteria
